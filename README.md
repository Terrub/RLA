# Introduction
RLA, or Rogue Like Attempt, is as the name implies, my attempt at making a rogue
like game.

# Goals
* Although I very much appreciate the ASCII based displays of the more oldschool
and hardcore games like Dwarf fortress, I don't like my users to have to
memorise ASCII character associations with objects. Rather I'd prefer to use a
tile based system with very simple pixel sprites instead.

* Another goal is that I'd want the entire game to be modular from a programming
perspective. Where I'd probably start with a lot of stubs I'd like to be able to
further expand and elaborate each individual system to greater and greater
complexity.

* The UI has to be as simple as possible with as fluent conveying of information
as I can muster. This will be a real challenge considering the circumstances
but it is a rather big point which is why it's part of the goals list.

* Finally, and rather obviously, I'd like the game to be fun and replayable.
This will of course include dynamic and/or random dungeons and perma-death to
the highest degree I can afford to make. The game should first and foremost be
engaging and secondly should have depth. Althought I intend to add quite a bit
of complexity to the game, it should not be a detriment to the depth.
